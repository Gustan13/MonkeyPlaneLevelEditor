# MonkeyPlane Level Editor
MonkeyPlane Level Editor is a tool to help me create maps for my game called MonkeyPlane. It was created using the **SDL2 library** and written using the **C Language**.

This project was created to make level making easier for my game and to learn more about tool creation in general.

## Running the Editor
This project requires you to compile it in Visual Studio 2022 and the SDL2 framework in order to run.

## How to Use
MonkeyPlane Level Editor allows you to place 5 different types of enemies along the y and the x axes. While the y axis is always constant,
the size of the x axis is customizable to create levels of different lengths and durations.

Upon saving the level, the program will create a .mpl file that will contain all of the level's information. To play it, put it in the "Levels" Folder in the MonkeyPlane project.

## Credits
This project was created individually by me with the objective of better understanding tool creation for windows and game development.
